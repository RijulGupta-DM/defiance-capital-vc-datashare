    "company_description": "GetYourGuide operates an online platform for booking tours, attractions, and activities worldwide. It offers tourist services online via the Internet and mobile applications. The platform sells tours and excursions, activities including cooking classes, and tickets to many tourist attractions. GetYourGuide runs a thriving and viral business curating, and selling tickets for running walks and other exploration experiences for people touring different parts of the world. The business model for GetYourGuide stipulates that it does not offer its tours or activities, but rather, acts as a mediator between customers and providers. The service is free for customers, but the provider of the tour has to pay GetYourGuide a percentage of its revenue. GetYourGuide, an online customer review system, enables potential customers to assess the quality of tour providers. Additionally, the platform removes providers who consistently get bad reviews from its inventory. Jochen Mattes, Johannes Reck, Martin Sieber, Pascal Mathis, Tao Tao, and Tobias Rein founded GetYourGuide on June 1, 2009.",
